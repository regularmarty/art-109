                <h2> About Me</h2>
                <p> born in a small town of Hollister, California. Ever since he was a young chap, he loved to draw
                    away through the days to perfect his craft. Creating numerous drawings that would soon evolve to
                    more sophisticated and intricate pieces that truly reflect his passion as an extension of his mind.
                    Martin is no stranger to taking chances,taking unconventional means to craft something he may not
                    have done before. Taking much enjoyment in learning new techniques and art approaches. Much like a
                    master wields a sword, He harnesses the power of the arts to bring his imaginative visions to life
                    in any shape or form he desires. He strives for his creations to outlast him, ensuring that a piece
                    of his creativity endures long after he’s gone.

                <img src="images/image1.jpeg" alt="Minds Eye" width="1280">
                <h3>Minds Eye</h3>
                <p>The work contains images of torn scraps of magazines, comic pages, and various other articles that
                    make up this pieces complex. The idea was derived from seeing someone elses mind and taking a look
                    inside what I would describe would not make a lot of sense to anyone at first glance, only to the
                    person whos mind it belongs to can tell you it does for them. </p>

                <img src="images/image2.jpg" alt="Skin tight" width="1280">
                <h3>Lend a hand</h3>
                <p>How many have heard the term it is better to let go than to hold on? That is what I ran with creating
                    this piece made from plaster, metal wiring, wax, and painted over with acylic paint. This piece aims
                    to visualize how often we hold on to things close to our hearts. Whatever we may hold onto our
                    hearts dearly will inevitably hurt us in the end.</p>

                <h3>Drink some</h3>
                <p>Inspired by Junji ito's artwork, I created a drawing that reflects a body horror into what already is
                    horrible alcoholism. </p>

                <img src="images/image4.png" alt="Pizza Parlor" width="680">
                <h3>Pizza Parlor</h3>
                <p>This piece was made during intro to 3D printing and the usage of Blender. I was toying with the
                    lighting and shapes and ended up making a pizza parlor for simple creation.
